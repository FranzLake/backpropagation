This project implements Backpropagation from scratch to train MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) networks. It displays a user interface (UI) where several hyperparameters of the MLP and the training can be adjusted. Some of those properties are: number of layers, number of neurons, number of epochs, % of samples for training, etc.

The directory named "Data" has five pairs of .txt files, composed of input data and targets. The targets correspond to results obtained after passing the inputs through a polynomial function.

To make the project work first run "main.m", this opens the UI where you got to load an input file and its corresponding file of targets. Pressing the button "Training" (Entrenar) automatically creates the MLP and trains it, using the selected values for the hyperparameters.

For reasons of time, I haven't properly explained the code, furthermore, comments in the code, as well as the UI still being in Spanish. Sorry about that.
